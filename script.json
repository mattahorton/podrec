    "HOW DO I LISTEN TO PODCASTS?": "Are you on iPhone? There should be an app called Podcasts built-in. I also recommend Pocket Casts or Overcast if you don't like that one.\nAndroid folks, Pocket Casts is my #1 recommendation, but most podcasts (except, WBEZ shows like Serial and This American Life, arguably the two most popular podcasts) are available inside Google Play Music which is built-in. %[Thanks!
